# AlwaysOnVPN

This script connects to [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/support/mac-vpn-setup/) after checking I am at home and I am not connected to my work VPN.

I care about my privacy but sometimes I do forget switiching it on when I am at home and doing my personal work. I have added this script as a cron but it can be invoked when your laptop comes out of sleep mode etc.

**Disclaimer:**

If you want to be super private and go dark I recommend using [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) . This script is just to keep me (mostly) away from snooping from my ISP.
